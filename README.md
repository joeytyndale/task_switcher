# task_switcher
Project to link finesse and workday with easy buttons for switching tasks

What we know so far:

Workday's POSTs contain a "sessionSecureToken" which is the same throughout an active session and a "clientRequestID" which varies with each POST/GET request. Don't know what that is yet or how necessary it is.
